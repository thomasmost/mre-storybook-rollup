# Minimum reproduceable example of Storybook bug with CommonJS exports?

I'm trying to use Storybook with a react component library bundled with CSS. The component is imported into a regular website at localhost:3000 and displays fine, but the Storybook preview errors with `The requested module '/@fs/Users/{user}/mre/packages/react/dist/index.js' does not provide an export named 'MyComponent'`
